"""Delivery of a user message into a chat slot, independent of the caller.

``POST /api/chat`` (a browser typing) and the session-control surface (one chat
session driving another) must put a message into a slot the SAME way, because
the interesting cases are all in the bookkeeping: a mid-turn steer has to be
registered before the RPC suspends, the transcript segment has to be cut at the
steer boundary, and a steer the live client refuses must fall through to the
queue rather than vanish. Two copies of that would drift, and the drift would
be invisible until a message was silently dropped.

The helpers here own that bookkeeping and nothing else — no HTTP, no request
parsing, no response shaping — so both call sites can layer their own
authorization and response format on top.
