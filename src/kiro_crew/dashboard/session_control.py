"""Session control: letting one chat session drive another.

Four operations — create a session, send a message to one, stop its turn, read its
transcript — plus the authorization that decides whether a caller may address a
target at all. The operations are deliberately thin: they reuse the same creation,
delivery, stop and history paths the dashboard itself uses, so a controlled session
behaves exactly like one a human is typing into.

Three properties shape the whole module.

**Delivery is a user turn, not an injection.** A message arrives on the target's
normal input path: steered into the running turn when there is one, queued when
steering is unavailable, or starting a fresh turn when the target is idle. There
is no side channel that bypasses the turn lifecycle, so stop, queue, context
accounting and the transcript all keep working as they do for a human.

**Provenance is never hidden.** The delivered text carries a one-line header
naming the sending session. A session that could type into another session
*as the human* would be an impersonation primitive; the receiving model has to
be able to tell the difference, and so does the person reading the transcript.

**Sending is restricted to sessions this caller created.** A session the user
opened themselves is never a send target. Delivery can be delayed behind the
target's running turn, and the user can change the target while a message waits,
so re-verifying the target's properties means re-verifying them at every moment
delivery can happen. Ownership does not move once set, which is why the boundary
is ``created_by_tab`` -- the creator's durable tab id, not its re-mintable slot
key -- rather than a list of things to re-check. Reading and stopping
are not restricted this way: both are synchronous and neither writes into the
target's conversation.

Authorization is deny-by-default and checked in one place
(:func:`authorize_target`) for the three operations that take a target, so a guard
cannot be present on one verb and missing on another. ``session_create`` has no
target; it checks the caller's own eligibility with the same refusals.
